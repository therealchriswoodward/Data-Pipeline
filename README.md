# OOP Data Cleaning

## An example of my OOP coding skills

_**Disclaimer: This is a vastly overengineered program for cleaning data. It is far simpler than this to clean data with Python. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming in a way related to data analysis.**_

This is a "Cleaner" class I created to perform a few different data wrangling tasks.

The code is documented well and puts on display my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming; the documentation even shows up in the tool tip when hovering over one of the functions:
