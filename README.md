# OOP Data Cleaning

## An example of my OOP coding skills

_**Disclaimer: This is a vastly overengineered program for cleaning data. It is far simpler than this to clean data with Python. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming in a way related to data analysis.**_

This is a "Cleaner" class I created to perform a few different data wrangling tasks.

The code is documented well and puts on display my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming; the documentation even shows up in the tool tip when hovering over one of the functions:

### Purpose and Motivation
While most data cleaning tasks can be accomplished using functional programming, implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles can make larger projects more modular, maintainable, and scalable. This project was designed to showcase how OOP can be applied in data analysis scenarios, especially for tasks that involve complex workflows or need to handle large datasets across different parts of a project.

### Features
- Implements common data cleaning tasks (e.g., cleaning up totally unreadable text, changing data types, generating new columns).
- Modular design using OOP principles, making it easy to extend with additional cleaning methods.
- Easily integrates into larger data workflows by allowing for reusable code components.
- Well-documented methods for clarity and ease of use, with integrated docstrings that display in tooltips.
